# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies. We had to help Martha create a report that included the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.

This classification report could be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.
We use the following methods for the analysis:
1. Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
2. Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
3. Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
4. Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
